If we ARE to part, it will at least be handsome to take your personal leave&mdash;but I have little heart to jest; in truth, I am serious enough; for to be sunk, though but for an hour, in your esteem is a humiliation to which I know not how to submit. I shall count every minute till your arrival.</p><p>S. V.</p></div> </div>
