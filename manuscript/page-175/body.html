<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I could not help asking Reginald if he intended being in London this winter, as soon as I found her ladyship's steps would be bent thither; and though he professed himself quite undetermined, there was something in his look and voice as he spoke which contradicted his words. I have done with lamentation; I look upon the event as so far decided that I resign myself to it in despair. If he leaves you soon for London everything will be concluded.</p><p>Your affectionate, &c.,</p><p>C. VERNON.</p></div> </div>
