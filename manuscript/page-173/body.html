<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Silly woman to expect constancy from so charming a man! but she always was silly&mdash;intolerably so in marrying him at all, she the heiress of a large fortune and he without a shilling: one title, I know, she might have had, besides baronets. Her folly in forming the connection was so great that, though Mr. Johnson was her guardian, and I do not in general share HIS feelings, I never can forgive her.</p><p>Adieu. Yours ever,</p><p>ALICIA.</p></div> </div>
